## General 

**What is VotePower?**

VotePower grants you a single vote on a pull request, allowing you to vote either for merges or against them to close. You can possess more than one VotePower (e.g., 100,000 VotePower). The total supply of VotePowers is capped at one million per project. Thus, if you hold 100,000 VotePower, you have 100,000 votes at your disposal.

**How does one use Turbosrc?**

If you hold VotePower for a project, simply visit its pull request page on Github. Features will load that allow you to vote and monitor ongoing activities. If you wish to add your project to Turbosrc, navigate to your project's Github page and open the Extension. The Extension will provide an option to add your project to Turbosrc. It will prompt you to sign into your Github account for authentication.

**Can VotePower from one project be used on another?**

No. The supply of VotePower is created by the initial maintainer for each project independently. You could possess 1 VotePower on Project A, 500,000 VotePower on Project B, or none at all on Project C, and so on.

**How does one acquire VotePower?**

Join the community of the project in which you seek VotePower. Project maintainers are advised to distribute VotePower to their contributors based on merit or to their sponsors.

## Contributors

**What is VotePower?**

One VotePower grants you a single vote on a pull request within a Turbosrc project. You can vote "yes" for merges or "no" to close. You can have more than one VotePower (e.g., 100,000 VotePower). The total supply of VotePowers is one million per project. No code can be added or removed from a project unless it is part of a pull request that has been merged or closed with VotePower. A majority vote is required to merge or close a pull request. Thus, if you have 100,000 VotePower in Project A, you have 100,000 votes, or 10% of the voting power. Some individuals, like maintainers or core contributors of a Turbosrc project, may own significantly more than others. This distribution depends on how the initial maintainer allocates VotePower among contributors, and what they believe is best for the project and community.

**Can VotePower from one project be used on another?**

No. The supply of VotePower is created by the initial maintainer for each project independently. You could possess 1 VotePower on Project A, 500,000 VotePower on Project B, or none at all on Project C, and so on.

## Maintainers

**What is the difference between a maintainer and a contributor on Turbosrc?**

A maintainer is the person who first adds an existing open-source project to Turbosrc. They can allocate VotePower and choose to retain or distribute as much or as little as they wish, effectively allowing them to retain majority VotePower if they so choose. There are no rules governing the distribution of VotePower, and maintainers can distribute different amounts of VotePower to various contributors. At present, to add a project to Turbosrc, you must already have a project on Github. That being said, Turbosrc has been designed to function across different code hosting services, making it cross-platform. Once you have allocated VotePower, you cannot reallocate it or take it back. Users are free to transfer their VotePower if they wish. However, if a user violates the network's terms of service and is removed from the network, their VotePower will be proportionally redistributed among the existing contributors, including the maintainer.

**Are forks of projects allowed on Turbosrc? Can I request the removal of a project that has forked mine?**

Any project with an open-source license can be added to Turbosrc. For a complete list of accepted open-source licenses, please refer to the relevant page on our site. Just as you can't remove a fork on Github, you also can't remove a forked project on Turbosrc. Forks are encouraged, as the essence of open-source is about sharing code. However, the value of a project is often based on the usefulness of its code and the strength of its community, along with network effects. Therefore, only a small subset of forks typically become more popular than the original project.
